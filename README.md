# Predicting affinities from simplistic protein-ligand interaction representations â€“ what do graph neural networks learn?

This repository contains the code for the work on protein-ligand interaction with GNNs, in which we investigate what GNNs learn by using explainable AI (XAI).

## Before you start
This code relies on the usage of [EdgeSHAPer](https://github.com/AndMastro/EdgeSHAPer) as an XAI method. However, there is no need to install it since all the files needed are provided in the ```src``` folder.

We suggest to run the code in a conda environment. We provide an ```environment.yml``` file that can be used to install the needed packages:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Note: this file was created from a conda working environment under Windows 11, so some packages may not be available in different versions/OS. We suggest to manually install them in this case. Edit the file with your system conda envs folder. We also provide the ```environment_no_builds.yml``` file for a higher cross-platform compatibility (minor manual edits to the file may be needed).

If you encounter problems during the installation of the PyTorch Geometric dependencies, manually install in the conda environment using:

```bash
pip install torch_sparse==0.6.15 torch_cluster==1.6.0 torch_spline_conv==1.2.1 torch_geometric==2.1.0.post1 -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.12.0+cu116.html
```
Note that the versions refer to the one in the ```environment.yml``` file. You are suggested to install such version to reproduce the results, but you are encouraged to try different versions to check for compatibility!

For compatibility with EdgeSHAPer code, [this](https://github.com/c-feldmann/rdkit_heatmaps) additional module should be installed. 

Finally, download the data we used in our experiments from [here](http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/labwebsite/downloads/pdbbind.tgz) (copy and paste in a browser the link address if the download does not start) and nzipped them into the ```data```.

The config file ```parameters.yml``` contains settable parameters that are loaded by the scripts provided in the repo.

## Train the model

We provide the ```trainer_script.py``` file to train custom GNN models (check ```parameters.yml``` for details).

To train your model simply run:

```bash
python trainer_script.py
```
Alternatively, to reproduce the experiments, you can use the pretrained models available in ```models/pretrained_models``` folder.

## Explain the predictions

Using one of the pretrained models, or any custom model trained with ```trainer_script.py```, you can use ```explainer_script.py``` to run EdgeSHAPer to generate explanations in terms of important edges. Among other parameters found in ```parameters.yml```, ```AFFINITY_SET``` defines the affinity set for which to run the explanations (low, medium or high). To explain the predictions of the model defined by the ```MODEL_PATH``` parameter for the selected affinity set, simply run:

```bash
python explainer_script.py
```

Files contatining edge importance as Shapley value estimates by EdgeSHAPer will be saved into the folder specified by the ```SAVE_FOLDER``` parameters.

## Top-k edges computation

Once the explanations for all the affinity sets are obtained, it is possible to run:

```bash
python top_k_computation.py
```

to generate statistics and graphics for the top-k important edges of the samples explained. Additional parameters accepted can be found in the config file ```parameters.yml```.

A possible top-k edges (k=25) output image may look as:
